End of year 1 exam at Noroff. The task was to build a blog that fetched content from Wordpress and built the pages dynamically. This was my first project were we could use javascript from the begining. 


## Description

This was my end of year one exam at Noroff. We had four weeks to create a blog site of our choice. We were to use all our knowledge in UX Design, HTML, CSS, JS, CMD & SEO. We were not allowed to use any frameworks or libraries. The content had to be fetched by making an API call to Wordpress and our blog specific pages had to be dynamically built. Our index page had to have an image carousel which showcased the latest blog posts. The images on the blog specific pages had to have a modal functionality. 

If we were finished with the level 1 process we could advance into level two, which was to add a search and filtering function to the blog post page and to add a functional comment section. I only had time to get started on the filtering. 

Things I want to add:
- functional comment section
- correct filtering
- Shopping site for merch
